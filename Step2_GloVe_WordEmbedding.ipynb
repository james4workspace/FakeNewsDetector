       "        'washington ( reuters ) - when jeb hensarling , the republican chair of the u . s . house financial services committee , released legislation this summer to weaken the major financial law known as dodd - frank , many said it was a pr ê t - a - porter plan that his party ’ s nominee , donald trump , could easily adopt . now that trump is president - elect , he appears to be doing just that . language about financial services posted on the trump transition website , www . greatagain . gov , echoes the tone of hensarling ’ s bill , known as the choice act . it calls dodd - frank , passed in the wake of the 2007 - 09 financial crisis and recession , as “ a sprawling and complex piece of legislation that has unleashed hundreds of new rules and several new bureaucratic agencies ” and promises to dismantle and replace it with “ new policies to encourage economic growth and job creation . ” hensarling ’ s legislation , which his committee approved in september , also takes a replacement approach . the texas republican had unveiled his proposal in trump ’ s hometown of new york in june , and then met with the businessman later in the day . at the same time , hensarling was mentioned as a possible treasury secretary by trump ’ s team . he has said he is not pursuing a cabinet position . “ the choice act accurately reflects the priorities that president trump has placed on the dodd - frank problem , ” said j . w . verret , an associate professor at the george mason university antonin scalia law school and financial regulation expert . verret regularly meets with and briefs members of congress and the securities and exchange commission on financial regulation . i think it is a great blueprint for everything that he has promised , ” said verret , a former republican congressional staffer . the hensarling blueprint would primarily allow banks to choose between complying with dodd - frank or meeting tougher capital requirements - primarily to maintain a ratio of tangible equity to leverage exposure of 10 percent . it would also reorganize the consumer financial protection bureau , throw out the volcker rule restricting banks from making speculative investments and eliminate the authority of the financial stability oversight council to designate non - banks as “ systemically important . ” it also differs from the dodd - frank legislation in the way it treats insolvent banks . hensarling says his approach will prevent taxpayer dollars from being used to bail out failed institutions . alongside obamacare , dodd - frank is considered one of democratic president barack obama ’ s signature domestic policies . the most senior democrat on the senate banking committee , sherrod brown , has been a vocal defender of it , as has liberal firebrand senator elizabeth warren . that means a dodd - frank revamp could stall in one chamber of congress . senate rules allow a single member to block a bill from proceeding to a vote . trump said last may that he would dismantle dodd - frank , primarily because the law makes it hard for banks to loan money . but few have called for total demolition of it , with bank industry sources privately saying they would like to see an easing of dodd - frank rules . trump campaign adviser anthony scaramucci , a wall street financier , said this week that the administration will review the law and “ the worst anti - business parts of it will be gutted . ” verret said he believes some components of the choice act will appeal to the populist anger felt by tea party members and trump supporters toward big banks . one such provision , he said , would place limits on how central banks can lend to financial institutions in times of crisis , an in effort to prevent future bailouts . this kind of reform , he added , appeals “ to both populists and free market thinkers at the same time . ”']],\n",
